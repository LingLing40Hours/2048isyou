In loving memory of my NPT in a car backseat.\
In loving memory of my childhood braincells.\

			glitch-like wave/region in which tiles will rearrange themselves\

			tribe of hostiles that has a 1-generator and tries to fill entire world with 2048s\
			tribe of hostiles that tries to merge all tiles?\
		occasional chest\
		also has Hostiles\
		slow, diagonally-moving passive tiles\
			push two adjacent tiles (at right angle to one another) with every slide\
		naturally spawned structures (chest, chest puzzle, tile puzzle, hostile fort)\
		if player in slide mode\
			sudden death when hostile touches?\

\
Built-In Bots\
	straight - goes straight\
	greedy - combines as much as possible\
	perfect - always finds path with fewest moves\
\
Pathfinder\
	sparser graph nah\
	greedier astar nah\
	multidest maybe\
	coroutines/multi-threading yes\
	optimal heuristics nah\
	dp with min_box (plus 1-2 layers) yes\
	hashed array tree maybe\
	rerun search when min_box updates\
	ignore maze corridor nodes\
	ignore middle-of-empty-space nodes\

\f0\b 	stop search if target enclosed by wall
\f1\b0 \

\f0\b 		trace wall upon encountering it, mark as traced (NAH)\
		floodfill using A* to ensure target isn\'92t enclosed\
	
\f1\b0 deadlock detection\
	D* (multi-A* with raise/lower propagation)\
	Modify A* so it searches for multiple starting points\
	ignore all empty space nodes except if meaningful action is possible\
		after macro A* finishes, use micro A* with dp to fill in path between nodes\
		micro A* can operate on empty space min_box instead of entire level\
		pushing tile might be non-meaningful\
			stop search if target enclosed by impenetrable tile cocoon and only useless tile(s) can be pushed\
		every time meaningful action is done (not including pushing free-floating tiles), try an A* to target (using a global visited array)\
			this isn\'92t guaranteed to be optimal\
	
\f0\b convert to iterative deepening A*?
\f1\b0 \
	don\'92t search split then push partner bc faster alternative exists?\
	
\f0\b debug IDA* not optimal
\f1\b0 \
	use z_hash()?\
	
\f0\b synchronize pathfinders\
	
\f1\b0 ui to indicate searching or search progress\
	don\'92t go for shortest path, try to anticipate player moves and keep options open\
	only copy row/col, not entire level when calling try_action()\
	jump points\
		include points where split/slide to adjacent tile is possible\
\
Achievements\
	recluse/oops/cocoon/hibernation/snug and sealed - trap yourself (by splitting, then merging the split tile)\
	pixel perfect - beat lv1 without using tiles (without pushing them into designated areas)\
	without a trace - manually reset all levels (without using new game button)\
	smuggler - beat Hello World\'92s maze the easy way\
\
Changing File Structure\
	close all scenes in editor\
	don't move scripts and scenes together\
	only move one scene at a time\
	try to open each moved scene\
	fix dependencies in textEdit if necessary\
\
Fixing Scene Parse Error Bug\
	close godot, remove lines 3 and 34 from ScoreTile.tscn, open godot and ScoreTile.tscn, run game, close godot (with ScoreTile.tscn open), re-add lines 3 and 34, open godot\
	close all scenes and the script ScoreTileFSM.gd, then close godot before running scons\
	if nc = 0/-1 bug, re-download godot (NAH)\
	if problem scene not open:\
		remove problem line in .tscn file\
		restart godot\
		open problem scene\
	else:\
		remove problem line in .tscn file\
		click Reload in Godot\
	re-add problem line in .tscn file\
	click Reload in Godot\
